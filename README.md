# GBM6700E

Project during echange at Polytechnique Montr√©al.

Here we are doing the 3D reconstruction of the spine from 2 2D images, using DLT (Direct Linear Transformation).
We study the effect of the number of calibration beads, and the effect on noise on the data on the quality of reconstruction.

run main.py to compute the reconstruction and plot analysis.
